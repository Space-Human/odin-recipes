Reflection:
This project was an excellent exercise for me in creating and organizing HTML documents, navigating files and performing operations using the terminal, and using git.

I feel more comfortable with all of those things after doing this project. There is still a lot I can learn and improve on, though it does not seem nearly as intimidating now.

I'm looking forward to moving onto heavier concepts and learning more about formatting so I can continue to build on this project in the future.
